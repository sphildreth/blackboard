## Phase 7: Visual & Usability Enhancements (BBS User Experience)
**Note: These enhancements are for users connecting to the BBS via telnet/terminal clients, not the admin interface**
- [ ] Design ANSI art screens and menus (classic BBS style)
- [ ] Implement color coding, real-time updates, and responsive layout
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation (hotkeys, tab, arrow keys, function keys)
- [ ] Add ability for ANSI screens to have template variables that are replaced at render time with system, user and connection information
- [ ] Integrate context menus and quick actions
- [ ] Ensure user input is echoed back so user sees real time key presses received by server
- [ ] Ensure that ANSI screen files are sent to connected user in a way that their terminal can display properly

---

## Phase 8: Inter-BBS Network Support
- [ ] Implement FidoNet protocol support (FTN, EchoMail, NetMail)
- [ ] Add QWK/REP and RIME/RelayNet support
- [ ] Develop network configuration and node management interface
