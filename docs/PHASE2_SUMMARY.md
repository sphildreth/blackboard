  - 256-bit hash output

- **Password Policies**:
  - Configurable minimum length (default: 8 characters)
  - Optional complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters)
  - Password expiration with configurable duration
  - Secure password generation for resets

- **Account Protection**:
  - Failed login attempt tracking
  - Configurable lockout thresholds (default: 3 attempts)
  - Temporary account lockout (default: 30 minutes)
  - Manual account lock/unlock by administrators

### 5. Session Management ✅
- **Secure Sessions**:
  - Cryptographically secure session ID generation
  - Base64URL-encoded session tokens
  - Configurable session duration (default: 24 hours)
  - Session extension capability
  - IP address and user agent tracking

- **Session Operations**:
  - Create new sessions on login
  - Validate active sessions
  - Extend session expiration
  - End individual sessions
  - End all user sessions (for admin actions)
  - Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

- **Background Services**:
  - Automated session cleanup service
  - Runs every 15 minutes to remove expired sessions
  - Fault-tolerant with error recovery

### 6. Audit Logging ✅
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**:
  - All user actions logged with timestamps
  - IP address and user agent tracking
  - Before/after value tracking for changes
  - JSON serialization of complex data

- **Audited Actions**:
  - User registration
  - Login attempts (successful and failed)
  - User logout
  - Profile updates
  - Password changes
  - Security level changes
  - Account lock/unlock operations
  - Administrative actions

- **Audit Queries**:
  - Retrieve audit logs by user
  - Filter by date ranges
  - Limit result sets for performance
  - Full audit history retention

## Security Features

### Password Security
- **Strong Hashing**: PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
- **Unique Salts**: Every password uses a unique cryptographic salt
- **Complexity Validation**: Configurable password complexity requirements
- **Secure Generation**: Cryptographically secure password generation for resets

### Session Security
- **Secure Token Generation**: 256-bit cryptographically secure session IDs
- **Session Validation**: Comprehensive session validation including expiration checks
- **IP Tracking**: Session bound to originating IP address
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Regular cleanup of expired sessions

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Hierarchical security levels with granular permissions
- **Account Protection**: Automatic lockouts and manual administrative controls
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for security monitoring

## Technical Architecture

### Services Implemented
1. **IPasswordService**: Secure password hashing and validation
2. **ISessionService**: Session lifecycle management
3. **IAuditService**: Comprehensive audit logging
4. **IUserService**: User registration, authentication, and profile management
5. **IAuthorizationService**: Permission checking and access control

### Models
- **User**: Complete user entity with security fields
- **UserSession**: Session tracking with security metadata
- **AuditLog**: Comprehensive audit trail records
- **SecurityLevel**: Enumerated permission levels

### DTOs
- **UserRegistrationDto**: User registration data transfer
- **UserLoginDto**: Login credential transfer
- **UserUpdateDto**: Profile update data transfer
- **PasswordChangeDto**: Password change operations
- **UserProfileDto**: Public user profile data

### Background Services

  LockoutDurationMinutes: 30
  PasswordMinLength: 8
  RequirePasswordComplexity: true
  PasswordExpirationDays: 90
  EnableAuditLogging: true
  EnableEncryption: true
```

## Testing and Validation

### Demo Application
A comprehensive demo application (`UserManagementExample`) validates all Phase 2 features:
- User registration with validation
- Authentication and session management
- Permission system verification
- Session lifecycle testing
- Audit logging validation

### Test Coverage
- User registration (success and failure cases)
- Authentication (valid and invalid credentials)
- Permission checking across all security levels
- Session management operations
- Audit log generation and retrieval

## Integration

### Dependency Injection
Full dependency injection support with service registration extensions for easy integration into the main application.

### Service Manager
Centralized service management for easy access to all Phase 2 services throughout the application.

## Next Steps

Phase 2 provides the complete foundation for user management and security. The next phase (Phase 3: Sysop/Admin Interface) can now build upon this secure foundation to provide administrative tools and dashboards.

All Phase 2 requirements have been successfully implemented and tested, providing a robust, secure user management system ready for production use in a BBS environment.
